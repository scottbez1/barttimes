ESP8266 + ST7789 IPS LCD Bart Times widget

Uses [IotWebConf](https://github.com/prampec/IotWebConf) to configure internet settings and other parameters. Generates and shows a wifi QR code when in AP mode to ease setup.

Every 30 seconds fetches the BART API to get departure times.

Eventually will use this to control a [splitflap](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap) display.
